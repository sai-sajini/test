S.No.,RC Category,Description
1,Change Failure,"Poorly planned, untested, or miscommunicated changes (code, infra, config) causing instability."
2,Capacity & Scalability Limitations,Systems overwhelmed due to traffic/load beyond expected thresholds or poorly sized resources.
3,Software Defects/Limitation,"Bugs or regressions in application code, services, or dependencies introduced during development.  Note: If this is defect introduced as part of a recent change then this is a Change Failure."
4,Infrastructure or Platform Failures,"Outages or faults in servers, cloud providers, storage, networking, or container orchestration layers."
5,Configuration Errors,"Misconfigured settings (e.g. feature flags, secrets, thresholds) impacting runtime behaviour.  Note, if the act of changing the configuration was the cause of the issue, then this is a Change Failure."
6,External Dependencies,"Third-party service failures (APIs, cloud services, CDNs, etc.) affecting availability or performance."
7,Operational Process Issues,"Manual errors, insufficient runbooks, or poor incident response processes."
8,Security Incidents,"DDoS attacks, unauthorised access, or other security events disrupting service."
9,Data Integrity & State Issues,"Corrupted, lost, or inconsistent data causing cascading failures or system instability."
10,Root Cause Undetermined / Still Under Investigation,Early in the investigation or postmortem — incident symptoms observed but no definitive technical root cause yet identified.
"Additionally, for issues in 3rd Party host managed services then we should record top-level category of “External Dependencies” with a “Party” field indicating the 3rd Party, and the underlying classification of the cause of the 3rd Party incident recorded in a separate field using the same list.",,
