Bot: Based on the provided context, here is a structured analysis of similar historical issues and their details:

When it Happened Previously?
Incident 1 (PIR - INC90624297/PBI71510):

Date: July 10, 2021
Description: Delay in processing batch impacting NDC allocations at the Foods Bradford DC.
Incident 2:

Date: April 22, 2021
Description: Delay in the overnight Quantum batch due to a job failure.
Possible Root Cause (RC) for This Issue:
Incident 1:

A new process in the ASO system was introduced to merge batches, which expected allocations from Quantum within 30 minutes.
Due to an overnight job failure in Quantum, allocations were delayed, leading to missed processing timelines.
The root cause was identified as insufficient testing during configuration.
Incident 2:

Failure of the Quantum job responsible for processing inventory transaction lists (ITLs) caused a significant delay.
This failure was due to duplicate records in the ITL table.
Possible Resolution:
Incident 1:

Manual intervention to trigger allocations to downstream systems.
Time limit for automatic order transmissions extended to 120 minutes, with instructions to manually trigger orders via Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
Consider automatic triggers to prevent manual dependency.
A permanent fix was deployed to resolve testing insufficiencies.
Incident 2:

A hotfix was applied to handle duplicates in the ITL table.
Investigation into the root cause of duplicates continued, and a permanent fix was included in the Greedo Release (June 28, 2021).
Recommendations for Current Issue:
Immediate Actions:

Verify if the issue relates to either a job failure in the Quantum system or manual triggers in ASO.
Cross-check logs for quantum batch failures or duplicate records if applicable.
Follow-up Solution Directions:

Ensure there is a clear SOP to handle manual triggers, if required.
Review whether recent job or configuration changes align with historical issues that caused delays.
If the details of your current issue do not align with the historical cases described, please provide additional specific details or context to assist further.
