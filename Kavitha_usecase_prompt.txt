Create a REST Assured API testing framework with Cucumber BDD for a Spring Boot REST API that manages products. The API has the following endpoints:

Base URL: http://localhost:8080
Endpoints:
- GET /api/products - Get all products
- GET /api/products/{id} - Get product by ID
- POST /api/products - Create new product
- PUT /api/products/{id} - Update product
- DELETE /api/products/{id} - Delete product

Product model:
{
    "id": Long,
    "name": String,
    "description": String,
    "price": double
}

Requirements:
1. Use Java 21
2. Use Maven for dependency management
3. Include the following frameworks/libraries:
   - REST Assured for API testing
   - Cucumber for BDD
   - JUnit 5 for test execution
   - Lombok for reducing boilerplate
   - Jackson for JSON processing

4. Create the following project structure:
   - src/test/java/com/example/
     - config/ (REST Assured configuration)
     - model/ (POJO classes)
     - steps/ (Cucumber step definitions)
     - CucumberTestRunner.java

5. Include Cucumber features for:
   - Creating a new product
   - Getting all products
   - Getting a specific product
   - Updating a product
   - Deleting a product

6. Add proper assertions and validations
7. Generate HTML and JSON reports
8. Include proper error handling
9. Use Spring dependency injection
10. Add logging for request/response on validation failures

Please provide all necessary files including:
1. pom.xml with all dependencies
2. Configuration files
3. Model classes
4. Step definitions
5. Feature files
6. Test runner
7. Properties files
