I want to generate a complete Selenium + Java + BDD + POM test automation framework from a UI screenshot. The AI should analyze the screenshot and automatically generate:
 
✅ Page Object classes with @FindBy annotations for all UI elements.
✅ Step Definitions that utilize all methods and variables from the Page Object classes.
✅ Feature files with dynamic test scenarios (positive and negative) inferred from the UI.
✅ Multiple Page Object classes, Step Definitions, and Feature files based on the UI components.
✅ Extent Reports integration for test reporting.
✅ Cross-browser support (Chrome and Firefox) via config.properties.
✅ Implicit waits of 20 seconds to avoid flaky tests.
✅ A config.properties file
✅ A pom.xml with dependencies for:
 
Selenium 4.24.0
WebDriverManager 5.9.2
Cucumber Java & JUnit
Extent Reports
✅ The project structure must follow MNC/product-based company standards:
 
src/main/java/pages
src/main/java/utils
src/test/java/stepdefinitions
src/test/java/runners
src/test/java/hooks
src/test/resources/features
src/test/resources/config
src/test/resources/testdata
✅ The output should be a ZIP file with complete working logic, ready to run without manual changes.
