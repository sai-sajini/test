Typically, the pair of load balancers remain in sync to allow a graceful failover. In this case, there was a subset of VIP pools that were not configured the same way on the passive load balancer. The third-party vendor identified a further bug that was deemed to be the cause of the load balancers not remaining in sync.
The Technology team further addressed this issue by executing a change to sync the passive load balancer after the disruption. The Technology team also implemented alternate telemetry to identify when load balancers are out of sync.

Preventative action:
To maintain the performance level that our customers expect from Salesforce and to prevent this defect from recurring, our focus is on continuous improvement. The Technology team has identified and is implementing the following actions:
Complete:
? Collaborated with the third-party vendor: The Technology team investigated the impacted load balancer to identify the full root cause of this incident with the vendor.
In Progress:
? Adding additional monitoring: The Technology team is implementing a configuration drift monitoring system between active/passive load balancers.
? Creating a remediation plan while the bug still exists: The Technology team is investigating a remediation plan for load balancers containing the identified bug.

Nice to have (future requirement) . Once payment moved offline, automate the throttling back of on-line payments.

 Amex
2. Apple Pay
3. Google Pay

It is their accountability to have full administrative rights to the Sorted carrier management system. In fact, one of the main reasons why Customer decided to migrate from the Metapack carrier management system to the Sorted carrier management system in 2020 was that the Sorted Carrier Management System allows business users to have full administrative control over the system which is fundamental to their business operation. It was therefore entirely correct that the Customer Carrier Management Team should be regularly housekeeping unnecessary user accounts. What the Customer Carrier Management Team user was not aware of at the time, was that the user account in the name of Gary Bennett is, in fact, the Sorted Ship API key account. Since the incident on 1st October, the Customer Business Carrier Management Team has now learned the lesson and will leave the user account in the name of Gary Bennett untouched until a more resilient and appropriate system of site-specific Sorted Ship API key accounts will be set up during Q4.
This incident was caused purely by a BAU business user housekeeping adminstrative process and has nothing to do with overnight batch jobs or anything similar.

28/08: The way that the load balancing works between the VMs is not cut and dry to 1 VM serving X amount of devices and VM2 the rest. Each request from the kiosk can be sent to either VM1 or VM2. Therefor in a single transaction journey the start basket request could be sent to VM 1 and then add item request could go to VM2 and so on throughout the journey. This would therefore flag the failed requests on the kiosk as an error based on which VM was serving the request at that time.
There are multiple calls throughout a customer journey  if there is an issue with one of the VM, it takes the session back to homepage.
21/08: Within Counter Solutions infrastructure, as one of the VMs had a problem, the load balancer was unable to determine the health of the VM and therefore, by default only traffic going through VM1 should have a problem. Awaiting further update from CS

05/11: Update from Ian: We have reviewed the major web conferencing platforms, features, pricing and licensing etc. The best fit for the stated requirements appears to be Webex. This platform would provide a completely seperate web conferencing platform from Microsoft Teams with dial-in capability and a dial-out add-on license available, both of which support India numbers and the other countries stated. Webex business £162 per host per year. Meetings up to 200 participants or Webex starter £114 per host per year - 150 participants. Both include local toll dial-in for UK, Ireland & India. Dial-out add-on available for £357 per host license per year (supports UK, Ireland and India). Note: max meeting duration 24 hours, prices quoted here are MRSP for annual billing (monthly pricing available). Zoom and Google Meet both have some limitations around dial-in/dial-out support for India so are not recommended above the Webex solution. Discuss with Sathish/Dinesh

Option 1  No design change.. instead.
- Setup a process to periodically check the status of the N7K Supervisors flash drive and where required run the flash recovery tool. This will prevent a recurrence of the need to reload the N7K to recover the flash drives.
- In the event of future maintenance windows required on the Nexus 7Ks, Dharma will disable VMware HA. This will prevent the automatic failover triggered by the witness.
- Note 1.. the Witness/VSAN environment will become redundant as part of the SP exit. The new Gen11 platform will use iSCSI protocol and not VSAN.

In circumstances where number of sessions is large, and/or when the firewall is processing many policies; and/or when configuration changes or AV/FSA update is too frequent  this can cause the IPS engine to become unnecessarily loaded, resulting in an observable CPU spike.

Technical details - In Red Hat Enterprise Linux8 the use of the global /etc/sysconfig/network file is deprecated, and specifying the gateway should now only be done in per-interface configuration files - Ethernet devices have a default route metric starting at 100, while logical interfaces like bond0 and bond1 start from 300 and onwards. If multiple bond interfaces are being used in the system, it is recommended to set explicit route metrics on each interface. This is because we cannot be certain which bond interface will load first during boot.
02/05: After the upgrade the network routing was changed.  There are two interfaces, one for publics traffic and the other for internal. After the upgrade the default routing was set to public, but after some time it switched to internal.  The internal route was removed manually and a debugging trace needs to be enabled in the next planned outage to see why it switched.

Also investigate why ROI stores were fully impacted and UK stores intermittently impacted.  This statement will also include granular detail of the discussions held prior to the change with Cyber and NOC teams.",Root cause,Chris McGrath/NLP team,"Background:
Twilio are expanding the Interconnect media services (with new IPs) for calls in all regions.
Twilio also are expanding the RTP port range to 10000-60000 UDP (Twilio are doing that to be able to support more traffic per IP. The more ports you have you can support more calls. As Twilio mentioned in the change log They are making this change to improve the flexibility , reliability and scalability of voice products.)
This change improves the flexibility, reliability, and scalability of our Voice products.
Twilio are using the new new Media Service and expanded port ranges listed below for all Voice Interconnect traffic.
 
2. Technical Impact:
In order to enable these new Media Services:
The new IP addresses must be whitelisted on the Customer perimeter Palo Alto Firewalls.
Enable the changes on the Customer Twilio Console Voice Configuration General/ Enable New Voice Media IP Ranges settings - toggle/option button with the new IP addresses in listed.
3. Impact if not done:
Any new Interconnect connections created after November 16, 2023 will be configured to use the new IP and port ranges. Failure to do so may cause one-way audio and dropped calls.
 
4. What Caused the Issue?????
The Ip's must be whitelisted in all interconnect platforms.
 
These 4 Ip's did not allow the traffic as the new Ip Ranges from Twilio were not allowed.
185.168.95.200 legacy pool only
185.168.95.201 legacy pool only
185.168.95.232 legacy pool only
185.168.95.233 legacy pool only
 
This caused one way communication to happen. To resolve this, we need to add the new Ip Range to mitel and sabio firewall.
168.86.128.0/18
UDP port range: 10000-60000 (expanding from 10000-20000)
 
why ROI stores were fully impacted and UK stores intermittently impacted. Twilio suspect that at this point would be that have different network paths for each country. Prashant also mentioned that Irish calls go via Mitel which might have something to do with this.
Once the ip's were whitelisted, the twilio Team was notified about this and they asked us to toggle the new ip's. once we toggled the new ip's it caused one way traffic to happen and the calls were impacted.
 
5. Discussions held prior to the change with Cyber and NOC teams.
Nlp Team Action: Nlp Team had a call with Angelos from twilio to confirm what are the ip's required to whitelist.
After getting the Ip's, Nlp Team raised a tufin request 3125 to implement the change on feb 28th.
On march 18 it cleared cyber approval and went for implementation.
With Cyber Team, Nlp Team had discussed that it was additional ip's that were required to be whitelisted to improve flexiblity.",NLP Team ,,NA,10/05/24,,Closed,,,,Saloni,16/09/25,#REF!,#REF!,#REF!,#REF!

The server is hosted in BY Azure like the earlier one before migration. This means that if there is any event when the servers are identified to be faulty then new virtual machines are assigned.

Before we could conclude on the approach to be taken, the event happened on the day when the database server had low memory leading to performance challenges and slowness.

It has been identified that a central image/configuration deployment model may not be suitable for the Dotcom fesk clusters due to the presence of customized configurations that need to be managed at the cluster level.
 
Additionally, the implementation of changes on both DR (Disaster Recovery) and Prod (Production) clusters simultaneously, especially in the aftermath of an incident at one location, has the potential to result in a complete outage of the application. This poses a significant risk to our resiliency and business continuity, potentially leading to a disruption in service.
 
These observations highlight the need to carefully evaluate deployment strategies and consider alternative approaches to ensure the stability and reliability of the Dotcom fesk AKS clusters. However, in the modernisation initiative of Cloud, its been considered to standardise the environment for platform clusters.

The query slowness needs to be reported by end user if any because query   slowness is related with many aspects like number of records being fetched, Partitions, Table size ,number of parallel queries running, Statistics updated or not   etc. Still, We will raise this with Vendor to check is there any way to monitor the query slowness even though there are no alerts on Cloudera Platform/ Impala   service.

Investigate if there is anything we can do to identify the larger categories in advance of the promotions being set and made live.  Mhorag/Gill to review the promotions amendment process in line with the Sparks team.,Problem avoidance,Gillian Oconnor,"The issue was that the BU missed offer detail from the brief.  In final offer testing we identified some lines in the WCS promotion that hadn't been added to the beanstore promotion (set up is done separately for the 2 systems). So we went back to amend the Beanstore promotion. This was the day before the offer went live so last minute pressure was a factor.
 
2 things to improve:
Minimise reliance on BUs to supply stroke/UPC information. We have been working on an automated source since Q2 which enables us get the data ourselves - project is still being worked on and in testing

This offer was set up late, so testing and QA checks were late, due to detail being agreed with the BU late and then clash with set up of Black Friday offers, making it a very busy time for offer set up. Unique to 12 days because for other offers we have managed lead times.
One for the 12 Days PIR to understand offer agreement deadlines pre Black Friday
The above is all being tracked in the 12 days PIR led by the product teams.

Normal store set up process  There are enough enhancements in place which will help identify any mismatches before the store set up process.
18/12: A workshop will be conducted in early January to enhance the store set up process through the below means - 
1.	Standardization - through the (i) mandatory use of a Front Sheet for all requests or (ii) elimination of the Front Sheet entirely and usage of the Site Request Form directly
2.	Optimisation - if the Front Sheet is kept, automation to pick all mandatory information from the Front Sheet into the Site Request Form, with potential logic to only accept and save pre-determined use cases
3.	Governance - a central owner of the process, who reviews (and potentially channels) all requests, and acts as the final sign-off for store setup.
Review the current process and figure out the key attributes responsible (E2E) to set up a store successfully before passing it to Master Data team  Collect the correct level information like Company code, sales org, etc.

1.	On 27/09, the Foods Critical job FOP309 failed due to a problematic UPC:
Foods Supply chain colleagues had raised a manual purchase order in Quantum with an incorrect (significantly high) order quantity. Due to this the application node went offline whilst processing the UPC resulting in job failure. As there is no restriction within SAP, while raising POs these scenarios cannot be prevented. However, there is a standard procedure agreed within the teams to handle the scenario by re-processing/skipping the problematic UPC

2.	Once the batch was recovered, Bradford DC reported slowness: Owning to the above Job failure, the bradford orders had started interfacing into WMS with a delay at 04:00. In parallel, there was a resource constraint (high CPU utilization) within one of the DB servers in the WMS system.

Hence we have seen that all the standard and custom reports were getting printed fine on that day.

The code was running with package logging on and it was writing large number of records in database whenever the receipt message from GIST DC was processed in Swindon DC. This usually comes between 11AM to 12PM on daily basis and during this period we see high number of records being written in database. On 26th there was slight increase in the volume and clubbed with other transaction being processed at same time, the DB reached its threshold on committing the DB transaction and started to slow down in processing these transactions, causing slowness in DC operations. 
Permanent fix: The package logging has been turned off now.
The below exercise is being performed to identify the spike in the data volume.  
1. Review the long running sessions, radius server.  
2. Review the DHL extract job to identify if it has contributed to the issue.  ",WMS Devops,,NA,09/11/23,,Closed,,,,Saloni,16/09/25,#REF!,#REF!,#REF!,#REF!

Objective of change: 

The current Azure Hub and Spoke design allows traffic to transit through virtual network gateways via Express Route, however this introduces a risk of lateral movement between portfolios. 

As part of security strategy, this change was deployed to add routes in the production foods route tables thus allowing all the traffic to go via either the azure firewall or PA firewall based in the flow. It will reduce the attacks and vulnerability issues.

The change started at 05:35, and it was implemented as per plan and completed at 07:00. After the work, alerting highlighted that a few areas had connectivity issues (MQ and ES API calls failing).

Accertify during the scheduled maintenance to upgrade its storage environment, there was a challenge in bringing the storage components back. This forced the Interceptas, ADI, and the Accertify Device platform to shut down due to the dependence on storage infrastructure to house virtual backend stores for the virtual machines that power the Accertify platform.
Eventually requiring a redeployment of infrastructure components to their previous version and restarting all of the virtual machines restored the services.

04/07 - There is already a Backlog item for E2E reconciliation (including each system) with David Davis (Foods Product Owner) to review and prioritise.  Also Joey is aware of the same

30/06 [SAP update] - E2E recon needs to be progressed via new requirement/Demand as every system has its own way of processing TPRs.
[POS update]: If expected price/store combination is provided to POS from upstream systems, it would take 2 hours for manual reconciliation in POS after food feed processing on the night(around 11PM). If any discrepancy is found, further concurrence would be needed from SAP/DS and business to make any updates needed.

15/05 - A call is being scheduled on 16/06 to devise a plan to reconcile the price changes across each system before processing.
16/06: Any type of recon between SAP, ES, FMD, DS, RET and POS will involve a significant volume of data comparison and efforts, which is time consuming and not sustainable as a manual activity; therefore the Engineering teams, across each of the apps and services within the P&P flow,  will explore viable/feasible options (if any) that could be utilised in order to perform reconciliation across the E2E pricing flow.
15/08 - Joey is still chasing up with the Product owner on the Backlog ID for the E2E reconcilaiton. 
30/08 - The action is included  as part of the Q3 which is long pending actoin. Since it has been added as an initiaive on Q3. This is surely beong worked upon. Thus closing this off the tracker.

Why was Customer impacted?
The change specifically impacted validation on the field items.retailerItemIds for which Marks and Spencer have a custom validation rule set up.

This system will be entirely new and as such the learnings from a SAP ECC release are redundant. ,Problem avoidance,Ben Dewitt ,"How can we make sure that Upgrade outage duration is estimated better (if possible)?
Comment:  Based on the earlier exp of the upgrade we assumed that a 1-hour buffer would suffice as it would be faster in the production environment. Production has more capacity in terms of CPU and memory and we have already added additional parallel jobs compared to Pre-prod environment.
Action: 1 hour buffer is not sufficient for an activity with this complexity, and additional contingency will be added for future significant SAP outages. COMPLETE
Could the DB performance issue have been picked up in testing?
Comment: since no further upgrades will be done in SAP ECC, the SAP S/HANA (new product, cloud based) will have new processes for automated testing and outage management. 
Action: None. COMPLETE

For the 640K missing sales (caused by upgrade defect), could this have been picked up in testing?
Comment:  21K sales messages were stuck in PO due  upgrade defect around 3 decimals issue; issue rapidly fixed and data reprocessed by Sunday for SAP and EDW. Test Coverage: Team has tested a scenario with 2 digits and it was rounded off successfully through SAP PO successfully and scenarios were passed. However, the issue happens when more than 2 decimal digits are flown in for WH_SMITH through A9 interface and thus the issue wasnt identified. Subset of scenario with more than 2 digits wasnt covered due to risk based test approach.
Action:  To prevent this, a new scenario is added in Core Regression suite for considering more than two digits in amount field of A9 and WH_SMITH interfaces while posting in SAP PO. COMPLETE

For the 15% late GMOR sales, how could this have been avoided during Batch Catchup after outage?
Action: confirmed with Sales and BW teams that after an outage the GMOR sales jobs should only be started once all inbound sales transactsions have been processed; it is better for the reporting data to be late than incomplete.

BW queue clearing prerequisite(1 hour): delayed since messages kept flowing into queue whilst BW team were clearing the previous messages
Action: Ensure inbound jobs are stopped and the messages in PO are all drained before commencing the BW queue clearance to avoid delays due to trickling in of additional messages. Queue Clearing Process agreed with team. COMPLETE
During version upgrade in production, the SLT triggers had to be dropped and tables regenerated in new EHP8. This consumed additional efforts eating into the buffer time (1 hour). Couldn't plan this as it didn't happen during non-prod upgrades(shadow).
Comment: As part of the upgrade process, as it's a live system upgrade process continuously try to create the triggers on the tables. As part of the pre-process activities, we have moved around 16K tables to the new tablespace to avoid the issue as we performed the same in our PT (DR system). But during the Downtime phase, it created more tables and created issues. For this, we had to move around 600 tables temporarily to the new tablespace created. After moving the tables to new tablespaces issue didn't occur.
Action: For this version upgrade we already started the pre-req and pre-upgrade process very early. As Prod is a live system this impacted on the upgrade execution. In the future maybe we need to start the activities based on the PT runtime with an addition of 4 days to avoid delays and not impact on a production system.

Fix the resolve this problem. Can we configure an alert?,Root Cause,Rhammya Somassoudirame,"19/10: Team identified that on certain weeks, the selective deletion program has not deleted the expected data with successful completion of the program leading with no alerts. The program has not deleted data as expected since the Stock reporting table has been locked in a parallel load to a different table. Whenever such locks are in the table, deletion cannot happen. But the Program is currently designed in such a way that the program completes for such locks without deleting the data.

Workaround:
As a workaround, we would re-design the job in Production to allow the Selective deletion program to run on an ideal window and make the parallel loading step to be in sequence to the deletion program. By doing so, the locking issue can be eradicated.

Fix:
As a permanent fix, we will re-design the program in order to throw an error whenever lock occurs to the table and causing deletion not to occur. Backlog ID SAP-GMORBW-00051 has been created for the same.",SAP BW team,,NA,19/10/22,,Closed,NA,NA,N/A,Saloni,16/09/25,#REF!,#REF!,#REF!,#REF!

Below is technical RCA shared by Infoblox
The reason for this behavior is as in the words of engineering team, When named_control sends SIGTERM to the named process while doing forceful restart then the idns threads will not exit immediately, when they are actively receiving the health updates. The threads which are not exiting wont return immediately until the timeout is expired or there is no more data to be received from the other end. Hence we need to forcefully exit the receiving sockets before another thread join / instantiation.
